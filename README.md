## Birth
At first, my purpose of creating this project was to practice web scrapping.
I was looking for a challenge which is a good idea to practice and I found the idea of this program.
So I started to write the codes and when I finished programming, I decided to put it in GitHub.

## Introduction
This is a program to extract the headings of the wikipedia pages.
You should just give the url of a page as input and then see the result.
The web page language should be English or Persian, otherwise the program will not work correctly; because the other languages or not supported.

## How to run
You can open the "Wikipedia Reader.py" with your favorite IDE and run it.
Or you can also use a command prompt to run this program.

## Used tools
- **Programming language**: Python

## TODO
- [ ] Improve the performance.
- [ ] Make a graphical user interface.
